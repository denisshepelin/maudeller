# Default decisions for kcats and Kms:
# If the value is known location is defined and scale can be 0.2 or estimated from BRENDA data
# If the value is unknown:
# kcat - location = 10.0, scale = 3.0 (from Davidi) 10th percentile is 0.21, 90th percentile is 467
# Kms  - location = concentration of metabolite in WT, scale = 1.5 For example if concentration is 10mM then 10th percentile is 1.46 and 90th percentile is 68.36
# This article is very useful https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chemrev.8b00039
# According to this article location of kcat should be 10 and scale should cover 10^-4 up to 10^6 
# Kms should be around 0.1 (100uM) and span range around 1e-6 up to 1e4 mM
